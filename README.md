# Project Title
To do list 

## Getting Started
#### The project is completed for front end evaluation. However i have left some features like login and sign up which i think are important for a to do list app. Right now the project has a starting page and another html page attached to it. The list can be made on the second page. 

## How to get it running on youur system
#### Pull the repo and save it in one folder on your local machine. Please use chrome browser as there are some bugs in mozilla as explained later. 


## Inspiration 

### https://en.todoist.com/
### Udemy web devloper bootcamp.

## Functions 

1. There is  a navbar which can be seen once the web page hit mobile size.
2. The Get started button is given an icon- (fa fa user) from fontawesome.io and clicking on it redirects the user to main app page.
3. The main app page has a to do list in which tasks can be added, deleted and marked off.
4. There is little animation added to delete the tasks CSS. 
5. A task which is completed can be marked off on the page by clicking on it. The text will turn greyish and a strike through will be made.

I wish to add the login and sign up function in this project in my latter commits.
